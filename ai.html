            <p>Create one website landing page utilizing HTML and
                CSS. The background should be a light-blue gradient,
                with a toggle to change between CSS themes. Have a
                textbox to describe the page. The page should be
                minimalist in nature. Generate both a HTML and one CSS
                file to accomplish this. There should be a Header at the
                top of the Page that has links to “Home”, “Projects”,
                “Qualifications”, “Services”, “A.I.”. Have “A.I. Page” be
                written at the top of the page. Abovethe prompt text
                box, have another text box that says describes ChatGPT
                and what you did to generate the page. Below the
                Prompt text box, Fill the content of the page with
                information about the history of Artificial Intelligence
