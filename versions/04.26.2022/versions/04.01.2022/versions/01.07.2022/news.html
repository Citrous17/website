      <h1>January 7th, 2022</h1>
      <p>Website Updated! I removed the "About" me section and moved the timeline into the news section and replaced the "block" style in favor of the timeline. I added promotional material for "Fruitilicious!" in a new page called "Apps". In the future, I plan for this to promote the other apps that are currently being developed but are not yet ready for promotion. </p>

      <h1>January 6th, 2022</h1>
      <p>Website Updated! The "About" me section now includes a timeline of events that describe who I am and what accomplishments I have achieved over the years. I have removed the "Contact" me panel in favor of a card on the splash page which includes my LinkedIn and Instagram. The news section will most likley have a timeline addition in favor of the current format of "blocks" in the future.</p>
