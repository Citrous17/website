      <h1>April 1st, 2022</h1>
      <p>The Navigation bar was changed to be centered to better flow with the centered design of the elements on the website. The News page was updated to now allow users to view older versions of the website. The Projects page was updated to include Fruitilicious, and downloads were moved offsite to not overflow the size of the website with each update, since website updates are now being archived. The fade-in feature was reintroduced and a loading screen was added when loading is depending on fetching media (Images/Videos). 
      Implementation of dynamic webpages is introduced but not optimized for all pages. Finally, a lower navigation bar was added to quickly access my Instagram and LinkedIn and included a copyright notice on the webpages derivate works.</p>

      <p>A lot of time has passed since the last update. Updates to the website include the contact button on the main page now letting the user send an email to myself about inquiries. I have also created a project page which lists various project that I have made over the past couple of years.</p>

      <h1>January 7th, 2022</h1>
      <p>Website Updated! I removed the "About" me section and moved the timeline into the news section and replaced the "block" style in favor of the timeline. I added promotional material for "Fruitilicious!" in a new page called "Apps". In the future, I plan for this to promote the other apps that are currently being developed but are not yet ready for promotion. </p>

      <h1>January 6th, 2022</h1>
      <p>Website Updated! The "About" me section now includes a timeline of events that describe who I am and what accomplishments I have achieved over the years. I have removed the "Contact" me panel in favor of a card on the splash page which includes my LinkedIn and Instagram. The news section will most likley have a timeline addition in favor of the current format of "blocks" in the future.</p>
