        <p class="gridText">I am currently a TAMU Engineering 102 and 216 Teacher's Assistant and Peer Teacher, respectively. I began teaching in the August of 2023, starting with Engineering 102 under the supervision of Dr. Jorge Lara. This position had taught me valuable lessons in communicating ideas with others, efficiently finding bugs and issues with coding projects, and having a work-life balance. I am passionate about fostering a strong foundation in Engineering and enjoy teaching when I can. Building these valuable connections with students have improved my code comprehension abilities and, hopefully, spark a passion in Computer Science and Computer Engineering principles.</p>

        <p class="gridText">I have been involved with the Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity since August of 2023. The fraternity is committed to a "Better Men, Better Lives" motto. We are active in getting dogs adopted from homeless shelters and in cleanup efforts around College Station. Every semester, the fraternity hosts "Dog Days", in which we work towards getting dogs that have been looked over by dog shelters into warm and comfortable housing. We had started our philanthropic efforts by cleaning up Kyle Field after every home game. Recently, the fraternity was involved in the cleanup effort at the Engineering Career Fair in Bryan, Texas. Learn more about the fraternity at the website that I had created for it below!</p>

        <p class="gridText">I currently own a Candy Business! I had created this company on August 14th, 2023. I had wanted to start a candy company back when I was in high school, but lacked the funding to do so. Snow Bite Candy specializes in Freeze Dried (FD) candies, which are made using a Harvest Right Freeze Dryer. Examples of candies that we sell include FD Skittles, FD Salt-water taffy, FD Starbursts, and FD Marshmallows. I am hoping to have a portion of funds be donated to cancer-treatment charities, as I personally know how it has effected friends and family. My hopes is to expand the company with custom packing, a distribution location, and promote cancer-awareness research with higher percentages of donation.
