        <p class="gridText"><i>Fruitilicious!</i> was a project I had worked on during the summer of 2021, after I had graduated high school but before entering college. It was heavily inspired by <i>Cookie Clicker!</i> It was developed in the Unity engine with C#. Although this wasn't my first experience with C#, it was by far my biggest project utilizing the language. The devleopment cyclye took approximatley 3 months, with 1 extra month spent on adding content after release.</i></p>

        <p class="gridText">During my freshman year, I had developed an interest in the TikTok algorithim. With this interest in mind, I had worked on the TikTokAPI which was origionally made by David Teather. The API utilized webscraping techniques with credentials created with a new TikTok account. With this project, I wanted to do a spinoff project where users could predict if a video would do well or not. I have stopped working on this, but may return to it in the future.</p>

        <p class="gridText">In the Spring of 2023, Tiktok had exploded with videos that combined Reddit stories with relaxing video footage, usually Subway Surfers or even clips from Family Guy! With this project, I had created an automated python script which will download the hotted reddit post at that moment, convert it to text-to-speech, and then combine the TTS with an video clip. The resuling video can then easily be upladed to TikTok. The account got 71 followers and 2246 likes before I suspended the project.</p>
